# CAG Passenger Monitoring Dashboard V1.5

An Ubuntu-based FastAPI, React, MQTT, and multi-camera computer-vision system for tactical passenger monitoring and assistance evidence.

## Operator quick start

After completing [README_UBUNTU.md](README_UBUNTU.md) and configuring `backend/.env`, run from the repository root:

```bash
bash start_ubuntu.sh
```

Open `http://localhost:8000`. The dashboard reports model-loading progress and enables **Start Session** when the persistent CV worker is ready. Operators see only session status and Start/Stop controls; technical model and camera settings remain outside the user interface.

The command provides:

- one Mosquitto broker, reusing an existing port-1883 listener when present;
- FastAPI and the compiled React dashboard on port 8000;
- an idle CV worker that preloads the enabled YOLO, MediaPipe, TransReID, role, and MiVOLO models;
- safe single-session Start/Stop control;
- cleanup limited to processes started by this deployment command.

## Tester workflow

The detailed engineering launcher remains available independently:

```bash
bash launch_tracker_ubuntu.sh
```

It exposes camera, GPU, calibration, model, threshold, fusion, ReID, MQTT, map, logging, and recording settings. It and the dashboard worker share configuration construction and a runtime ownership lock, so they cannot consume the cameras and GPUs simultaneously.

Use `bash start_dev_ubuntu.sh` for Vite/FastAPI development.

## Configuration

Create the private configuration once:

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

At minimum configure real camera sources:

```text
CAMERA_URLS=cam_1=rtsp://username:password@192.168.50.192:554/Streaming/Channels/101,cam_2=rtsp://username:password@192.168.50.81:554/Streaming/Channels/101
PRIMARY_CAMERA_ID=cam_1
MQTT_ENABLED=true
MQTT_HOST=localhost
MQTT_PORT=1883
```

Do not commit `backend/.env`. Camera credentials remain on the backend and are not returned to React or written unredacted to service logs.

The production CV preset is configured with `CV_*` variables documented in `backend/.env.example`. Current defaults preserve the tester launch behavior: two cameras when configured, YOLO on GPU 0, TransReID/MiVOLO on GPU 1, MediaPipe auto delegate, appearance ReID and demographics enabled, 480 cm map size, and 5-by-5 visual grid.

## Session states

```text
offline → loading → ready → starting → running
                       ↑                  ↓
                       └──── stopping ────┘

Unrecoverable worker/model/session error → failed
```

Only `ready` permits a new session. Repeated Start for the active run is idempotent, Stop while idle is safe, and conflicting transitions return HTTP 409.

## Control security

Start/Stop accepts localhost requests by default. Read-only dashboard data may still be viewed over the LAN. To enable LAN control deliberately, configure both:

```text
CV_CONTROL_ALLOW_LAN=true
CV_CONTROL_TOKEN=replace-with-a-long-random-secret
```

Remote control then requires `X-Operator-Token`. The dashboard presents this as an operator access code and keeps it only in memory.

## Relevant API

```text
GET  /health
GET  /api/cv/status
POST /api/cv/session/start
POST /api/cv/session/stop

GET  /api/status
GET  /api/cameras
GET  /api/cameras/{camera_id}/stream
GET  /api/metrics
GET  /api/metrics/trends
GET  /api/zones/status
GET  /api/tactical/latest
GET  /api/alerts
GET  /api/evacuees
GET  /api/evacuees/summary
GET  /api/reports/shift.csv
GET  /api/reports/shift.xlsx
```

The CV status contract includes `state`, `ready`, `running`, `run_id`, timestamps, worker PID, loading stage, safe error text, MQTT reachability, and whether the current request may control sessions.

## Data flow

The tracker publishes lightweight telemetry to:

```text
cag/metrics
cag/tactical
cag/alerts
```

FastAPI subscribes and stores metrics, alerts, tactical state, ReID galleries, and assistance evidence. Images and embeddings use FastAPI endpoints rather than MQTT. The dashboard tactical view renders the globally fused map; the camera selector affects only the live preview.

Passenger evidence is an assistance aid, not face recognition or proof of a person’s real identity. Staff must manually verify model-provided role, age, gender, and ReID results.

## Logs and recovery

- CV worker and state transitions: `LogEvidance/cv_service.jsonl`
- Mosquitto started by the script: `LogEvidance/mosquitto-server.log`
- Technical test runs: `LogEvidance/*.console.log`

See [README_UBUNTU.md](README_UBUNTU.md) for installation, LAN access, troubleshooting, and recovery commands.
